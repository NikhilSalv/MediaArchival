# 🗂️ Media Archival System

- “I developed a multithreaded Python application for a digital marketing client to automate their daily media content archiving process. The system parsed a list of URLs extracted from campaign reports, downloaded all the relevant images, PDFs, and media, and automatically organized them into categorized folders. Using multithreading and retry logic, I brought down the daily processing time from over an hour manually to under 5 minutes with automated error logging and recovery. This improved their content turnaround and reporting pipeline efficiency by over 80%.”


## 🎯 Client Requirement

A digital marketing agency runs multiple brand campaigns and tracks their coverage across dozens of news websites and blogs daily. They want to build a **Media Archival System** that:

- Downloads image and document files (e.g. `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`) from URLs provided in daily media reports.
- Categorizes downloads based on file type:
  - **Images** → `/downloads/images/`
  - **PDFs** → `/downloads/documents/`
  - **Videos (if any)** → `/downloads/videos/`
- Handles large volumes efficiently with **multithreading**.
- Logs failed downloads for later retries.
- *(Optional)* Adds **timestamp-based folder structure** like `/downloads/images/2025-07-29/`.

## 🧠 Why This Makes Sense in Real Life

- Media agencies track **PR mentions** and **campaign visuals** from 100+ sources.
- Manual download and categorization is **tedious and error-prone**.
- Automating this:
  - Improves efficiency
  - Reduces human effort
  - Ensures **timely archival**
